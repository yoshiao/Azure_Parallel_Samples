This project contains one class for each recipe containing code in Chapter 4.

The project is a simple WPF application with a single page with a button for each class.
Pressing this button invokes a static method of the class which exercises all the methods in the class.
The project should be run in a debugger to enhance the learning experience.

The only configuration entry used by the project is a DataConnectionString specified in app.config.
This needs to be a valid connection string for the Azure Storage Client Library classes. The recipes can be used
against either local storage or cloud storage.
